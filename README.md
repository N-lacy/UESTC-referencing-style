# uestc-referencing-style
A referencing style for uestc thesis

**NB: This tutorial assumes that you have downloaded, installed, and set up Mendeley Reference Manager on your PC.**

Copy the link for **IEEE_UESTC.csl** and paste it in your **Mendeley Cite** word add-on.

## Step 1: Get the reference style link  
Open **IEEE_UESTC.csl** on github and click the **raw** tab to view the raw code. 
**IEEE_UESTC_mod.csl** is a modified version that tries to handle cases where the type isn't specified and marks them in your bibliography with **[X]**. You can use this instead, and look for any such marks in your bibliography and correct them accordingly.

Disclaimer: This citation style is not an official style from UESTC. This is an update on a work done by a former international student of UESTC. It is done to follow the UESTC citation rules to the best of our abilities.
Here's a simple sample guide for the UESTC Citation style

.

[13] First letter of First name. full spelling of family name, second authors, third authors. title [type of reference]. Name of journal, year, volume (No.): pages-pages  

  Type of reference:   journal ---[J]; conference paper—[C]; book –[M]; thesis—[D]; Newspaper articles—[N]; report—[R], patent—[P], standard—[S]
  
Journal:   [1] authors. Title[J]. name of journal, year, volume(No.):pages-pages

Conference paper: [1] authors. Title[C]. proceeding of conference, space of conference, date of conference, pages-pages

Book : [1] authors. Title[M]. place of publication: press, year of publication, :pages-pages

Thesis: [1] authors. Title[D]. place of university: university, year, pages-pages

Newspaper: [1] authors. Title[N]. name of newspaper, date of publication

.

Sometimes, all the details of a reference won't be automantically added to Mendeley, go through your bibliography and modify accordingly.

This file can also be used in other reference manager software. However, I provide no tutorial for those. You can find them online.
